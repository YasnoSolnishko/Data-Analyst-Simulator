There is an AA test data from '2022-12-25' to '2022-12-31'. The task is to simulate as if we conducted 10,000 AA tests. At each iteration, you need to form non-repeating sub-samples of 500 users from the 2 and 3 experimental groups. Conduct a comparison of these sub-samples using a t-test.

1. Build a histogram of the distribution of the resulting 10,000 p-values.
2. Calculate the percentage of p-values that are less than or equal to 0.05.
3. Write a conclusion about the conducted AA test, whether our splitting system works correctly.
4. Send a link to the merge request with the conducted analysis.
