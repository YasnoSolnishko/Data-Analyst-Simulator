# Karpov Courses Data Analyst Simulator
## Description
Data Analyst Simulator is a comprehensive repository containing practical tasks completed during the internship in Karpov Courses. During the internship, I  built and automated analytical processes from scratch.

## The goal
My objective is to establish and automate analytical processes from the ground up. The company's product is an app that offers a news feed and messaging capabilities.  

## Analytical tools
The repository contains various analytical tools created for this project, including dashboards, daily reports, alarm reports, metrics analysis, and A/B tests. Since the data is live, I provided screenshots of task completion.
