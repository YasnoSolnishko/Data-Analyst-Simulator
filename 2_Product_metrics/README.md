# Product metrics
## Task
The task is to analyze and compare the retention of these two groups of users.

There are two types of users in the news feed usage data: those who came through paid traffic with source = 'ads' and those who came through organic channels with source = 'organic'.
## Result
Retention rates diagram for both groups were done. 
The diagrams supporting the conclusion could be found on the pic below.  
### Conclusion
From the diagrams, it can be seen that there is a difference between the two groups. On the first day, there were more users coming from "ads" traffic than from "organic" traffic. However, the retention rate for "organic" users decreased more slowly than for "ads" users. Thus, **"organic" users are more loyal to the application.**
