# DASHBOARDS

The main task was to create two basic dashboards covering key audience metrics and events for a news feed product. The task involved adding relevant graphs, slices, and metrics to the dashboards. The goal was to answer the question "how much?" in the initial stages of analytics. The solution required creating an operational dashboard with graphs for the current day and a primary dashboard for past data. 
The final deliverable is three dashboards.
